I'm a lifelong coder and storyteller who's been immersed in technology since childhood. At 11 years old, I started programming on the TI-99/4A, which led me to assembly language on the Apple II, working with the 6502 and 65816 processors. By 18, just two weeks out of high school, I began my career as a video game programmer, contributing to titles like Rock N' Roll Racing, The Game Genie, and Wing Commander on the SNES (21 SNES games in all). I later worked on PlayStation and Sega Saturn projects, including Propaganda, gaining experience in game development.

Before that, in the 80s Apple II scene, I was involved as a cracker with a warez group, learning about reverse engineering and community collaboration in those early days. That experience carried over as I helped with the initial development of WinAmp (I'm listed in the credits at the bottom) and co-founded the #winprog channel on EFnet IRC with Doug Mealing, a place where many programmers shared knowledge on Windows development.

In the years since, I've taken on roles like Chief Architect at a Fortune 5 company and CTO for several private equity-funded startups. Lately, I've been focusing on AI, having coded neural networks and keeping up with the field, while providing technical and organizational consulting to PE clients to connect AI with business needs.

On this blog, I'll share some technical insights—from retro computing to current AI topics—along with personal stories about the ups, downs, and unexpected turns in my path. I hope you'll join me in exploring the ways code, creativity, and life intersect.
