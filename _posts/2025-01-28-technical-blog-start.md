Welcome to my technical blog! As a chief architect, I'll be sharing proof of concepts and technical findings here.

## What's Coming

- C#/.NET Core patterns and best practices
- Cloud architecture decisions
- Performance optimization techniques
- Real-world proof of concepts

## Quick Example

Here's a simple pattern I use for dependency injection:

    public interface IService<T>
    {
        Task<T> GetAsync(int id);
    }

More technical content coming soon!
