<h2>About Allen</h2>

<p>I'm a lifelong coder, tinkerer, and storyteller who's been immersed in technology since childhood. At just 11 years old, I dove into programming on the TI-99/4A, sparking a passion that led me to assembly language on the Apple II—mastering the 6502 and 65816 processors along the way. By 18, fresh out of high school, I landed my first gig as a video game programmer, contributing to iconic titles like Rock N' Roll Racing, The Game Genie, and Wing Commander on the SNES (that's 21 SNES games in total!). I later expanded to PlayStation and Sega Saturn projects, including Propaganda, honing my skills in the fast-paced world of game development.</p>

<p>Before all that, in the wild 80s Apple II scene, I was a cracker for a notorious warez group—those were the rebellious early days that taught me the ins and outs of reverse engineering and community-driven innovation. I carried that spirit forward, helping shape WinAmp in its infancy (check the credits—I'm there at the bottom) and co-founding the legendary #winprog channel on EFnet IRC with Doug Mealing, where countless programmers cut their teeth on Windows development.</p>

<p>Over the years, I've scaled up to executive roles: serving as Chief Architect at a Fortune 5 company and CTO for multiple private equity-funded startups. These days, my focus is on AI—I've built neural networks from scratch and stay fluent in the latest advancements. I spend my time providing technical and organizational consulting to PE clients, bridging cutting-edge AI with real-world business strategy.</p>

<p>Through this blog, I'll share the technical deep dives that excite me, from retro computing hacks to modern AI architectures, alongside personal life stories—the triumphs, failures, and quirky detours that have shaped my journey. Join me as I explore the intersection of code, creativity, and everyday adventures.</p>
